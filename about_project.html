                A black hat visualization is intentionally inappropriate, overly complex and/or too cluttered for the audience Labels, 
                Titles are skewed to intentionally influence the viewer's perception, The data has been transformed, 
                filtered, or processed in an intentionally misleading way.
                The Above image shows the black hat visualization version of deaths by Gun Shots in US.
                This Bubble visualization represent total number of deaths i.e, males and females.
                <br><br> 
                Death distribution per each state is unavailable. Coloring of States is not done properly to indicate deaths. 
                Title of the visualization is misleading. Visulaization doesn't properly give information either about age or gender of deaths.  
                The bubbles do not serve any real purpose in giving helpful information. These drawbacks make visualization hard to apprehend.
                <br><br>
                <b>White Hat</b><br>
                White hat visualization is clear and easy to interpret. Any data transformations 
                (e.g., filters, additional computations, etc.) are clearly and transparently communicated.
                This visualization is the improved version of black hat visualization. 
                It gives information about Gun Deaths in different states and cities in the USA.
                <br><br>
                All of the data fits into the visualization without withholding any data. 
                In this way, Maximum Data Density is maintained throughout the visualization.
                The improved visualization has readable labels, captions, age and gender distribution.  
                Users estimate the number of casualties by looking at the color of a state on the map. 
                Visualization is highly responsive, easily understandable.
